In this study, we investigate the application of the DenseNet architecture for multimodal COVID-19 diagnosis, using CT scan images as the main model for disease diagnosis 
and behavior. Thanks to a comprehensive analysis of deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks, we see the potential of DenseNet to increase the accuracy and 
efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis, especially in healthcare. Our experimental results show promising results, and by combining DenseNet with CT scan images, we achieve a 
significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, allowing further identification and classification of suspected COVID-19.
